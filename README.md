### Hi, I'm Sahil 👋🏽

I am a senior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a
minor in Spanish. I'm involved in multiple <a href = "https://acm.org" target = "_blank">ACM</a> special interests groups
including SIGGraph and SIGMusic where I am president and a former chair respectively. As part of UIUC's
<a href = "https://reflectionsprojections.org" target="_blank">Reflections|Projections conference</a>, I have also held 
leadership positions in MechMania, an AI hackathon, working as game engine and visualizer leads. My interests are varied 
and include computer graphics, audio processing, and cybersecurity.
