### Hi, I'm Sahil 👋🏽

I am a software engineer at Samsung SARC/ACL working on GPU drivers. I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022 with a degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in Spanish. I have internship experience at Samsung, AARP's The Tech Nest, and Nokia. I also have international experience with a semester abroad in Stockholm at KTH and a service trip to Guatemala. I love exploring new technologies in side projects -- you can learn more about those at my [personal website](https://sahilshahpatel.com).
